  <h3>Variable Definitions</h3>
  <br>
  <h4>Target Variable</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Revenue: </strong> this variable is our target variable. This is what our model is predicting,if the shopping experience is revenue generating or not.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h4>Numerical Variables</h4>

     <li><strong>Product Related Duration: </strong> This is the total amount of time in <strong>seconds</strong> that a user spent of Product Related websites.</li>
     <li><strong>Bounce Rates: </strong> The value of "Bounce Rate" feature for a web page refers to the percentage of visitors who enter the site from that page and then leave
       ("bounce") without triggering any other requests to the analytics server during that session.
     </li>
     <li><strong>Exit Rates: </strong> The value of "Exit Rate" feature for a specific web page is calculated as for all pageviews to the page, the percentage that were the last in the session.</li>
     <li><strong>Page Values: </strong>The "Page Value" feature represents the average value for a web page that a user visited before completing an e-commerce transaction.For example each time a user gets to
     the checkout form, they will increase their page value by 'x' amount.</li>
     <li><strong>Special Day: </strong>The "Special Day" feature indicates the closeness of the site visiting time to a specific special day
       (e.g. Mother’s Day, Valentine's Day) in which the sessions are more likely to be finalized with transaction.
       The value of this attribute is determined by considering the dynamics of e-commerce such as the duration between
       the order date and delivery date. For example, for Valentine’s day,
       this value takes a nonzero value between February 2 and February 12,
        zero before and after this date unless it is close to another special day,
        and its maximum value of 1 on February 8.</li>
    </ul>

      <h4>Categorical Variables</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Month: </strong> Categorical variable for which month the current user visited your website (January and April Missing).</li>

        <li><strong>Traffic Type: </strong>Unlabeled categorical variable that assigns categories depending on traffic type.</li>
        <li><strong>Visitor Type: </strong>Type of visitor falls under three categories, Returning, New, other. We suspect that the other category refers to transactions and visits that were done from a third
        party platform and thus cannot be correctly classified.</li>
        <li><strong>Weekend :</strong>A binary variable to indicate whether the visit was made on a weekend. Will take the value of True if it was made on a weekend and False if it was during a weekday.</li>
      </ul>
